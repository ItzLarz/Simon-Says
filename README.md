# Simon-Says

I recreated Simon-Says in Visual Studio. My second project while in quarantine.

If you want to run it, use VS 2019 (I don't no if it wil run in other versions) Just push Open with Visual Studio, then clone the GitHub repository in Visual Studio to a path on your computer and then you can start the program.
